## num-luck

A simple game to pass the time.

## How to play

1. A random number is generated within the specified range.
1. Click on a cell or use number keys (1-9, 0 for 10) to place the number.
1. Numbers must be placed in ascending order from top to bottom.
1. The game ends when all cells are filled or no valid placement is possible.
1. Win by successfully filling all cells!

For example, if we had a grid that looked like this:

```
1. 8
2. 45
3. 98
4.
5. 189
6.
7. 200
8.
9.
10.
```

If the next number that was generated was 55, we would lose as there are no open spaces to place it.

If you get to the end of the grid without running out of spaces, you win!

## Motivation

This is a game I saw someone manually playing on a Twitch stream once and I thought it was a surprisingly simple, but entertaining concept. I also really wanted to see how much of the game AI could produce. So I put the two together!
