## num-luck

A simple game to pass the time.

## How it works

The goal of the game is to place the random numbers that are generated in numerical order without running out of spaces to place them.

For example, if we had a grid that looked like this:

```
1. 8
2. 45
3. 98
4.
5. 189
6.
7. 200
8.
9.
10.
```

If the next number that was generated was 55, we would lose as there are no open spaces to place it.

If you get to the end of the grid without running out of spaces, you win!
